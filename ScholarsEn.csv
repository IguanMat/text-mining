Mon-coach i,37 reviews,We had so much fun,"""We had so much fun. It was my first time going to a club with my son. The drinks were perfect, and the music and karaoke were great too.""",Date of visit: June 2022,5,,,,
GoldstarDancer,31 reviews,Shocking Overcrowding,"On our trip to Rome we spent about 1/2 hrs in Scholars bar on St Patrick's Night. 
The Traditional Irish group didn't know the lyrics to the songs they were singing. 
The bar was way overcrowded and it was more like Hill 16 on All...Ireland Finals day.
If there had of been a fire nobody would have got out without being trampled on or seriously injured. 
It was an experience of St Patrick's day to forget.
Price of drinks are what you would expect for Rome.
Would we return probably not if it's more about grabbing the euros than promoting an Irish traditional pub.
This is a true account of our visitMore",Date of visit: March 2023,,,,2,
theokietravelbird,47 reviews,Best Pub!,We went there for St. Patrick's Day and had a wonderful time. The music was amazing and the bar staff was so kind and attentive. It was clean and had a great atmosphere. It was the perfect bit of Ireland in the middle of Rome!,Date of visit: March 2023,5,,,,
AndreaE2327,1 review,Very rude security staff,"They let enter first just the girls they like, while me and my friends were waiting for more than 2 hours outside. Moreover, if you ask for explanations, the dark-skinned bodyguard treats you badly, answering you with bad words and mocking you.
It’s a pity...because the atmosphere inside would be a 5/5.
I saw many people leaving before entering, because of this absurd situation with the entrance policy.
If I was the owner, I would be very worried about how my guests are treated by that rude employee.
I’m sure I’m not the only one who next time will choose another Irish pub in Rome; more than 30 people waiting in line with me had the same thought!More",Date of visit: March 2023,,,,,1

marble4,56 reviews,Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.,"Avoid this place like the plague if you want decent food. Possibly the worst food I have ever witnessed and the service is not much better.
6 of us squeezed onto a table that would barely hold 4 people. 2 of the chairs were broken,...the others were filthy. The darkness of the venue hides the dreadful state of food on offer. 2 dishes turned up partially frozen and another looked like it had been dropped on the floor, trodden on and then put back on the plate. The ‘food’ is quite clearly frozen food from a local cheap supermarket. Our suspicions were raised when we were asked to pay for the ‘food’ beforehand. Our mains turned up with the starters and on complaining, we were told by the abrupt and rude staff to eat the food or the dishes would be thrown away if returned to the kitchen and that they had taken our money anyway and didn’t care if we ate the ‘food’ or not. I didn’t see any satisfied diners and witnessed so much uneaten food. A staff member told me the manager was to blame but didn’t care.
If you want a drink, be patient and it ain’t cheap. Lazy, disinterested staff everywhere. Even the doorman is miserable. An attempted novelty venue, but falling way below par.
You’d be better off getting a take away from McDonald’s, a few cans from the off licence and sitting outside in the rain. It’s dreadful. Avoid.More",Date of visit: March 2023,,,,,1

mcgStaffs,19 reviews,Disappointed,"The place has a wonderful Irish pub feel, and can imagine when it is full there would be some atmosphere.  We popped in for a drink and food at the end of a long day of sightseeing.
We had a pint of lager €7 and...a double gin and tonic €17. The pint price is the going rate for Rome, but the gin was a little overpriced. 
Gin was what you would expect, the lager on the other hand was fowl.  It tasted and smelt like sweaty feet. 
We decided not to try the food and left with the lager undrunk.More",Date of visit: March 2023,,,,2,
